And I'd give up forever to touch you<br/>
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow<br/>
You're the closest to Heaven that I'll ever be<br/>
And I don't wanna go home right now<br/>
And all I can taste is this moment<br/>
And all I can breathe is your life<br/>
And sooner or later, it's over<br/>
I just don't wanna miss you tonight<br/>
And I don't want the world to see me<br/>
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand<br/>
When everything's made to be broken
        </label>
    </div>
